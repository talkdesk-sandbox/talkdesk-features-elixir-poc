# Feature Flags

Talkdesk uses Split to manage Feature Flags. However, the company is taking advantage of clients provided by Split, which does not offer a Elixir client.

The objective of this task is to develop a Proof of Concept (POC) for an Elixir client that connects to Split and is capable of retrieving and validate features.

## Installation

The POC was developed using Elixir version 1.7.3.

To check if you have the correct version use the following command:

```
elixir --version
```

If you do not have the correct version or do not have elixir, you can get it from the [Elixir website](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
